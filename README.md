 Eazy-Live
 
Eazy-Live is an AutoHotKey script that will make your life so much easier in Windows.

If you ever used Linux or Mac OS, then you will easily notice that Microsoft  Windows shortcut keys are very horrible,  they're very bad for your productivity and your life in general. So we've created this script to make our life in Windows so much easier.
By creating emulation of Linux shortcut keys, we got you covered.
We will replace some hotkeys, whenever we feel Windows lacks it.
